<p class = "p2">
I first met Dashie at Anacostia Park in Washington, DC. I had just traveled from New Hampshire with my new human. We had spent the previous night in a motel in a place called New Jersey. All the smells were different. My skin was feeling itchy in this new place. I didn't know what was happening, or whether I was going back to New Hampshire. I was just hoping my new human wouldn't leave my side. It was all very overwhelming. </p>

<p class = "p2">After trying to scare Dashie off, I realized she just wanted to play. So we played in the field. I kept an eye over my shoulder the entire time though. You can never be too careful in these situations. </p>

<p class = "p2">Later that night, Dashie tried to steal my water. She was up to no good and wanted to leave me with nothing. I would die of dehydration, hunger, and loneliness. I couldn't let this happen. I'd been through too much. I had to act.

<p class = "p2"> I was starting to feel less and less like myself. I was angry and scared at everyone except my new human. I still liked meeting new people, but I just didn't feel safe.  </p>

<p class = "p2"> Eventually, a nice food lady came to the house, and we spent a lot of time together. I love learning new things and making everyone happy. I also started getting these weird tasting circle things in all my meals.  </p>

<p class = "p2">  I cannot believe my first "gotcha day" is around the corner. I love my new home so much. I play with Dashie all the time. And I have a crush on her sister Scootie. She is so nice and pretty. I also get to meet  seniors and children at the park and on our walks. Everyone who isn't afraid of me loves me and I love them! Although other dogs still make me weary. But I am beginning to think they are okay after all. We shall see. </p>

              <p class =  "p1"> <span style="font-weight: 90; color: #ffffff;">  

              My parents are all star dogs from a breeder in New Hampshire. One day, when I was a puppy, this lady Sue picked me up and brought me to a new home. I immediately fell in love with with my new humans, especially the grumpy old man who really wasn't too grumpy. I was a surprise gift to cheer him up after his previous dog passed away. 

              <br>
              <br> 

               That might sound like some big shoes to fill, but I was mostly focused on chewing toilet paper, chasing the cats in the house, and digging holes in the yard. It was around this time that I met my (now) new human. She would play with me all the time. It was amazing. The old man couldn't chase me like she could. 

              <br> 
              <br> 

              Eventually the old man passed away. I was very sad and withdrawn. Sue was worried about me and said I needed a change of scenary. She wasn't wrong. 

              <br>
              <br>
             I didn't realize what was happening at the time, but when my new human picked me up, I sprinted to her car. I was ready to go. I didn't realize where to, or the adventure I was in for, but I'm so grateful to have a new home.
