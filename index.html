 <div class = "large-12 medium-12 small-12 cell">
	<p>As retail and property crime soar and police ranks continue to thin, Maryland neighborhoods, apartments, big box stores, fast-food chains, hospitals, banks and schools now rely on private security guards to deter crime and provide a sense of safety. </p>

	<p>The number of private security companies and detective agencies in Maryland saw a 48.25% jump from 2017 to 2024, according to a Capital News Service analysis of the Maryland State Police licensing division’s public databases. There are 1,060 security agencies licensed by the state, and some of them offer private investigative services.  </p>

	<p>These companies are being hired, in part, because Maryland has become a target for organized retail crime, with its multiple major highways and ports along the 95 corridor to rush merchandise out and more lenient sentencing for repeat shoplifters, said Cailey Locklair, president of the Maryland Retailers Alliance. </p>

	<p>Retailers feel “if the system is going to break down and fail all around me, I have to do something," she said. </p>

	<p>“Private security officers are really the first responders,” said Steve Amitay, founder and executive director of the National Association of Security Companies. In Maryland, security guards are also unregulated and unmonitored; that changes incrementally on June 1, when a new law takes effect. </p>

	<p>The law, <a  href="https://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2023RS/fnotes/bil_0000/sb0760.pdf" target = "_blank" > Senate Bill 760</a> passed in 2022, was prompted by a series of fatal security guard shootings. At the time, Maryland lawmakers “were shocked to hear that the state had no minimum requirements before putting somebody on a post in a security guard uniform,” said Nick Paros, Regional Vice President of Allied Universal Security Services, the third-largest private employer in North America and seventh in the world. Paros is also a retired Maryland State Police officer who testified about the legislation before the Maryland Assembly.  </p>

	<p>But this isn’t unique to Maryland. </p>

	<p>“The fact is, some states have no regulations. Some states have poor regulations, and some states have fair regulations. But no state has admirable, replicable regulations,” said Robert McCrie, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. </p>


	<p><br></p>

	<h3><strong> Experts weigh in on Maryland's new security standards and certifications bill</strong></h3>

	<p><br></p>

	<p>The new security standards and certifications bill going into effect on June 1, 2024, prohibits uncertified security guards from fulfilling their services until they complete 12 hours of training approved by the Maryland Police Training and Standards Commission. </p>

<p>Training programs must cover relevant criminal law, appropriate use of force, use of alternative force, de-escalation techniques, and prepare security guards to adequately interact with minors, individuals with behavioral health or other disabilities, and those in crisis. After completing the initial 12 hours of training, security guards must complete eight hours of continuing education every three years.</p>

<p>Security guard employers must adhere to general liability insurance requirements and report all use of force incidents—the discharge of a firearm, pepper mace, or electric control device—to the Secretary of State Police.</p>

<p>Some experts believe this is not enough. </p>

</div>

<p>“Personally, I think it’s a great thing that is kind of a long time coming,”  said Chris Pullen, vice chair of Baltimore’s chapter of the American Society for Industrial Security.</p>

<p>The new training will be paid for either by security companies or individual guards. Pullen, who represents many of the larger companies that already train their employees, said the requirement will “even the playing field,” because right now,smaller companies that don’t spend money to train their employees can underbid the larger companies that do. </p>

<p>Security professor McCrie, however, was disappointed with what he called the new law’s “de minimus” training requirements. The new law requires an additional eight hours to renew an initial three-year license. McCrie said the best security organizations train monthly or even weekly. </p>

<p>“When you think of the issues that almost any security guard could face, and say, ‘Well … every three years you should have eight hours of training,’ I think that’s really hard to argue,” he said. “It’s so little.”</p>

<p>Rodney Hill, a retired Lieutenant Deputy District Commander in Montgomery County who oversaw internal police affairs and now teaches law at Stevenson University, doesn’t think the training requirement in the new law is enough either.</p>

<p>“... but I love the fact that it’s a great start, he said. “Maybe you start with 12, get to 40, then 80.”</p>

<p>The Department of State Police’s general fund expenditures increased by $476,900 in FY 2024, according to the SB 760 Fiscal and Policy Note, to be allocated toward staff and one-time technical system upgrades. </p>

<p>Hill doesn’t believe the budget will be enough. “I can tell you right now. They don’t have the capacity,” said Hill, after sitting in a meeting with the Maryland Police Training and Standards Commission discussing the new bill’s implications on the department’s capacity and budget. </p>

<p><br></p>

<h3><strong> For the 5% of the time something happens </strong></h3>

<p><br></p>

<p>Meanwhile, security guards are asked each day to calm parents who are irate with social workers and to de-escalate angry shoppers yelling at store clerks. They act as orderlies in hospitals, concierge in apartments and deterrence in stores to would-be thieves. </p>

<p>“The majority of our issues are just dealing with irate customers,” said Ronald “Trey” Cole, a regional manager at Trust Consulting Services, a security company that supplies 60 to 80 guards to Maryland state agencies, including the Department of Social Services, child support payment? buildings, and district courts.34  “You have people that come into [the] child support building, you know, something’s wrong with their payment or something like that, so they’re already upset. A lot of these customers will get into it with the individuals that work at these agencies.”</p>

<p>The frequency of mass shooter events has prompted churches and even libraries to reach out with inquiries, he said.</p>

<p>“I think a lot of people are just more security conscious because you just never know what's going to happen at any given time,” he said. “...From my experience, 90% of the time nothing's going to happen, it's going to be a quiet day. But you want security for that five or 10% of the time that things may happen.” </p>

<p>For 20 years, the State of Maryland has relied on private security companies. Currently, the contracts total $43 million, mostly toprovide 140 security guards at 10 different agencies, said Nick Cavey, a spokesperson for the Maryland Department of General Services. </p>

    </div>

<p>For eight years, Alex Godfrey, 43, has worked part-time as a security officer at the Ross Dress for Less discount clothing store at the <a href= "https://www.mfirealty.com/property/laurel-lakes-centre/"  target = "_blank"> Laurel Lakes Shopping Centre </a> in Laurel to supplement his full-time financial services job. “I’m a banker by day, crimefighter by night,” Godfrey said, chuckling on the phone. </p>

        <p>He likes that he provides a sense of safety to shoppers but is frustrated by a wave of shoplifting since the COVID lockdown, he said. Private guards like Godfrey are not allowed to detain shoplifters. The thieves, Godfrey believes, know this too. “They go into Ross and grab everything, and walk out knowing that you cannot touch them or apprehend them,” he said.</p>

        <p>Godfrey can’t arrest shoplifters either, but he knows the people who can: Police and off-duty police patroling the shopping center. </p>

        <p>Officer Edwin Monarrez has been a patrol officer with the Laurel Police Department for the past ten years. Police officers hired off-duty sit in the parking lot a few days a week at Laurel Lakes Centre, waiting for calls from loss prevention staff. </p>

        <p> The Ross store manager had told Monarrez that the same group of individuals had been shoplifting clothes multiple times a day but that the store’s policies required her to get corporate authorization before calling the police for help.</p>

        <p>“She’s telling me that they’re stealing three times a day…and we haven’t gotten one call for service for a couple of weeks now,” Monarrez told Capital News Service while sitting at his desk at the Laurel Police Station. </p>

        <p>A few months ago, around 8:45 p.m., a couple came into the store who appeared drunk, Godfrey recounted. The man began throwing towels and random items into his cart while the woman stuffed items into her purse. </p>

        <p>Godfrey called the non-emergency police number, and a Laurel police officer stationed outside, entered the store. Once the officer arrived, the man left his cart of mounting items behind. The woman tried to check out but her credit card did not work. They both left and jumped into a car waiting for them in the parking lot, and drove off. </p>

        <p>The police responded quickly, he said, whereas a year ago, the Laurel Police Department was busy with other crimes, and people would get away.</p>

        <p><br></p>

       <h3><strong>Private security pushes crime to poorer neighborhoods in Maryland</strong></h3>

       <p><br></p>

<p>Caprice Smith, a criminal justice lecturer at Stevenson University, retired from the Baltimore City Police Force in 2014 as a special investigator. She believes private security will “probably be harmful to criminal justice in this country,” recounting private security’s role in the United States before public police departments were established.</p>

<p>In the beginning, people who could afford to hire private security were protected. If you didn't have the resources to hire security, you suffered, Smith said. </p>

<p>Universities and their immediate areas have less crime, she said, but often do not reflect the community at large. “You can’t have such separate societies. It has to be integrated and inclusive.” </p>

<p>Under the new law, the Maryland Police Training and Standards Commission is responsible for monitoring the new security guards regulations and training. “I can tell you right now. They don’t have the capacity,” said Hill, former Montgomery County Police Department official, who was part of a group tasked to figure out how to implement the new law.</p>

<p>“We are now at the point,” said Paros, Regional Vice President of Allied Universal Security Services, “where the state is recognizing that security isn’t in the same category as lawn maintenance and housekeeping.”</p>
