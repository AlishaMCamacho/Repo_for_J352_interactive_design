<h2> <strong> TWO WORLDS. ONE HOUSEHOLD.  </strong></h2>

          <p style="
             font-size: 24px;
             text-align: left;

        On <strong>April 1, 2023</strong>, Dashie and Dexter's lives changed due to unforeseen circumstances. Dashie's peaceful home and routine changed forever when a temperamental ~100lb German Shepherd moved in. 

        <br>
        <br>

        Over time, Dashie discovered that Dexter simply needed patience and care. While she delegated many responsibilities to her humans, Dashie took charge of several critical tasks.

        <br>
        <br>

        In the following months, Dashie taught Dexter how to play with toys, where to find feral cats to chase and bark at, and, perhaps most importantly, how to intimidate the mailman with great fervor. Dexter is still mastering this skill.

        <br>
        <br>

        This is their story. And it is not for the faint of heart.
