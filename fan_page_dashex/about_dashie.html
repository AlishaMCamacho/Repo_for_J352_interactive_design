<h1> <span style="color:#17362c;"><em><strong>Hi, I'm Dashie!</strong></em></span></h1>
<br>
<h3>Technically, my name is Rainbow Dash, but my friends call me Dashie. </h3>
<br>
<p class = "p2">
I met Dexter at Anacostia Park in Washington, DC. I was shaking with excitement and elated to meet my new friend. I also had not seen my human's other woman in a very long time, and couldn't believe she was back home. It was all so exciting. </p>

<p class = "p2">We played and ran and played and ran some more. It was the <strong> BEST. DAY. EVER. </strong> or so I thought. </p>

<p class = "p2">After dinner, I was drinking water from <strong>MY</strong> water bowl, when Dexter growled and bit me out of nowhere. I thought we were friends. He didn't break my fur coat, but I was very scared and confused. This was the worst April fools day joke ever.

<p class = "p3"><strong>Photo Caption:</strong>This photo was taken on our first night together. Dexter is sitting next to my sister Scootie. Little did we know how much danger she was in, as this was moments before he bit me. </p>

<p class = "p2"> I quickly realized it was up to me to keep everyone safe. So I took it upon myself to teach Dexter the ropes, while keeping my distance when he was moody. </p>

<p class = "p2"> My humans also took action and he had to start eating some medicine which made him more normal. A new food lady also started coming to the house. I got to eat so many treats and learn new tricks. It was amazing. </p>

<p class = "p2">  It has almost been a year, and Dexter still has his moments, but he is so much more fun to be around now. We can play. And cuddle. Although any cuddling is kept to a minimum. I'm not crazy, you know. </p>

              <p class =  "p1"> <span style="font-weight: 90; color: #ffffff;">  

              My first owner was a mean lady. She sold me to a college student at a gas station when I was a few months old. He was concerned about my well-being. 

              <br>
              <br> 

              The college student didn't know how to take care of me. He would try to get me to fight with another dog for fun. I also felt very loopy when they smoked this bad-smelling thing. He and his friend did this a lot. He also didn't have enough money to feed me, so I ate a sock and had to have emergency surgery. The college student decided to give me up after this. 
              <br> 
              <br> 
              His friend's girlfriend, Rachel, took me in and gave me to her brother, Seth, the bestest human in the world. I grew up with Seth, Rachel, their two other sisters and parents, and my adopted sister Scooty. It was the bestest life a Dash could ask for.
