		<p><strong> WASHINGTON, D.C. </strong> — A resident uncovers boulders, pieces of plastic toy dolls, oyster shells, bricks, and rebar beneath the ground of a newly constructed home in southeast D.C. </p>

		<p>“The more I dug, the more determined I became to help transform this dirt left behind into healthy soil,” said resident Alisha Camacho. “I just couldn’t believe developers are getting away with burying mountains of debris and trash on site.”</p>

		<p> Neighbors took notice of Camacho’s efforts as they watched her dig up the yard for months on end. </p>

		<p> “I told my husband that this girl was digging up her husband's grave,” said Ms. Sharon as she walked by Camacho’s house one evening. “More seriously, though, I was rooting her on. I think a lot of neighbors were.”</p>

		<p> “I kept asking her where her husband was while she was out there day and night digging away,” said Mr. Hendrick, a senior veteran who lives down the street. “She told me her husband wasn’t allowed to do yard work, which was a response I respected and laughed at.” </p>

		<p> After removing mounds of rubble and trash, Camacho was eager to plant the native four-season garden with shrubs and flowers she had meticulously researched. </p>

		<p> “The hardest part was honestly choosing native plants that are not toxic to dogs or cats. My sister-in-law’s dog lived with us at the time, and this Pitt eats everything,” said Camacho.  </p>

		<p> Only time will tell whether the plants will take to the soil. July isn’t an ideal time to plant shrubs, but given the many obstacles derailing the initial timeline, Camacho was eager to wrap up the project and plants to adapt as needed. </p>
